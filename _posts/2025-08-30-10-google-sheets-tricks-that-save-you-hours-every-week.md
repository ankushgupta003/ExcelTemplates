Google Sheets isn’t just an online spreadsheet—it’s a powerful tool that can make your work faster, smarter, and easier. Whether you’re managing finances, running a business, or simply keeping track of your daily tasks, these Google Sheets tricks will help you save time every single week.

Let’s dive in 👇

### 1. Use Keyboard Shortcuts

Stop wasting time clicking menus. Some handy shortcuts:

* **Insert row:** Ctrl + Alt + = (Windows) or Cmd + Option + = (Mac)
* **Open insert link box:** Ctrl + K
* **Fill down:** Ctrl + D

👉 The more you use shortcuts, the faster you’ll work.

### 2. Freeze Rows & Columns

When scrolling through large data, freeze the header row so it always stays visible.

* Go to **View → Freeze → 1 row/column**.

Perfect for budgets, attendance sheets, or long inventories.

### 3. Use Conditional Formatting

Make your sheet “talk” to you visually.\
Example: highlight expenses above ₹10,000 in red.

* Select range → **Format → Conditional Formatting** → set rules.

- - -

### 4. Create Drop-Down Lists

Avoid typing errors and keep data consistent.

* Select cells → **Data → Data validation → Dropdown**.

Example: Add categories like *Food, Rent, Travel* for your budget tracker.

### 5. Explore the “Explore” Feature

Click the **star-shaped Explore button (bottom right)**, and Sheets will automatically give you charts, summaries, and insights—without writing a single formula.

- - -

### 6. Use Filter Views

Instead of disturbing your main data, create personal filter views.

* Go to **Data → Filter views**.

This lets each person in a shared sheet analyze data their own way without changing it for others.

- - -

### 7. Split Text into Columns

Got messy data like "John Doe - Marketing"?

* Select the column → **Data → Split text to columns** → choose a separator (space, dash, etc.).

- - -

### 8. Protect Ranges & Sheets

Sharing your sheet but worried someone might break your formulas?

* Go to **Data → Protect sheets and ranges**.

Give editing rights only where needed.

### 9. Use Simple Functions Smartly

Some must-know time-saving formulas:

* `=SUM(A2:A50)` → adds values instantly.
* `=AVERAGE(B2:B50)` → finds average.
* `=UNIQUE(A2:A50)` → removes duplicates.
* `=IMPORTRANGE("SheetURL","Sheet1!A1:B10")` → pull data from another sheet.

### 10. Create Custom Templates

Instead of building sheets from scratch, save a master version of your template (like *budget, invoice, or project tracker*) and just duplicate it whenever needed.
